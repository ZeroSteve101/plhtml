### PlHTML  

HTML-based audio player with metadata read using [music-metadata](https://github.com/Borewit/music-metadata), queue shuffling, and ReplayGain support.  
Files are processed locally, nothing is sent to the server. (Meaning that you can download the html and run that).  
Supports anything supported by the HTML audio tag (tested with MP3, FLAC, PCM WAV, OGG Vorbis, OGG Opus, AAC).  
Open the page, upload audio files, (optionally) click 'shuffle', listen!  

Uses [music-metadata](https://github.com/Borewit/music-metadata) and [Color Thief](https://github.com/lokesh/color-thief).
